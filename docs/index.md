## Here I will share my tested deployments with you!

Im running this kind of setup since years in my home-lab. Now im trying to make it available for everyone in a configurable more generic way.

Im using this project to learn more about all the technologies required to setup such stuff, but also as some kind of showcase for linkedin, headhunters and future employers.
